# Video-surveillance

The goal of this project is to realize a remote video surveillance tool. The basic idea is the following. Images are taken by a smart phone with an APP named "IP Webcam". The images are displayed in a browser on a remote computer but in the same WIFI network, i.e. the same SSID. The images in the browser are read and processed on this remote computer. The analysis results are sent to browser agains so that another remote computer can check them simultaneously.
